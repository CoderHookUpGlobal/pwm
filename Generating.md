    A hacker or computer can easily guess a weak password. 
    Here are the ways on how to create strong passwords;

 #   Must be at least 12 characters long. This is an absolute minimum. The longer the password, the stronger it is.

 ## Includes all different types of characters, both upper and lower case, numbers, and symbols.

 ###  Doesn’t use obvious substitutions such as swapping numbers for letters (“0” for “o”, “1” for “l”, “@” for “a”). While this can be a clever alternative for your user-name, it’s too obvious for your password. Any hacker or hacking software will quickly cycle through these substitutions to guess your password.

 #### Doesn’t use dictionary words, names, or places. As mentioned in the previous rule, hackers can try any possible variations of characters. To do this they cycle through many different dictionaries, which includes but is not limited to the English dictionary. This process cracks about two-thirds of all passwords.
